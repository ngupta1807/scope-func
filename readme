......................Start of scope Func........................................
Function   Object       return

also        it           context obj (call varibale outside scope)
apply       this         context obj (call varibale outside scope)

let         it           lambda result (get access of class outside scope not its variable)
run         this         lambda result  (get access of class outside scope not its variable)
with        this         lambda result (get access of class outside scope not its variable)

............................................................
Main Diff :
1. way they refer to context object
2. return value
context object -> this , it
..........................................................

ALso: takes context object as ref , used when we donot want to use this ref inside or outside
Apply :used for more complex chaining , donot return value , used to do operations on member obj.
let: used when we want to print result from 2 or more funcions
Run : (2 opeations) : can intialise values and return last line result
With : object passed as argument ,can perform operation on it , cannot return result
